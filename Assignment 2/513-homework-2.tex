Say $x$ is a number in $col_n$, and $y$ is a number in $col_{n+1}$.\\
Case 1: $x$ and $y$ are in the top (least) row, post-sort\\
\indent $y \leq z$, $\forall z \in col_{n+1}$\\
\indent $x \leq w$, $\forall w \in col_{n}$\\
\indent Because $y$ is in $col_{n+1}$, it must be greater than at least one elemen in $col_n$.\\
\indent As stated, $x$ is the least number in $col_n$.\\
\indent Therefore, $x$ is either that number, or less than it.\\
Case 2: $x$ and $y$ are in the bottom (most) row, post-sort\\
\indent $y \geq z$, $\forall z \in col_{n+1}$\\
\indent $x \geq w$, $\forall w \in col_{n}$\\
\indent Because x is in $col_n$, it must be less than at least one element in $col_{n+1}$.\\
\indent As stated, $y$ is the greatest number in $col_{n+1}$.\\
\indent Therefore, $y$ is either that number, or greater than it.\\
Case 3: $x$ and $y$ are in any other row\\
\indent an $x$ and $y$ in row m must have been greater than exactly m other\\
\indent \indent elements in their respective row.\\
